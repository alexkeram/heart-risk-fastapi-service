    "# Project M1: Heart Disease Risk Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of a Data Science course and focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease in patients.\n",
    "We have a training dataset with medical indicators and patient habits, as well as a test dataset without labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main goals of the project:\n",
    "- explore the data and identify key factors that influence heart attack risk;\n",
    "- perform preprocessing and detect target leakage;\n",
    "- build and compare several models (sklearn, CatBoost);\n",
    "- choose the optimal quality metric and explain the choice;\n",
    "- prepare a reproducible ML pipeline with the ability to perform inference on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final solution format\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the project should include:\n",
    "- a Jupyter Notebook with EDA, data analysis, and model training results;\n",
    "- a library (Python modules) containing classes for data processing and inference;\n",
    "- a FastAPI web application that accepts data and returns predictions;\n",
    "- model artifacts in `joblib` format (for sklearn) and `cbm` (for CatBoost) with a meta file `artifacts/best_meta.json` for loading;\n",
    "- predictions on the test set in `.csv` format with columns `id` and `prediction`;\n",
    "- documentation with instructions for running the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech stack\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python (OOP, modular architecture)\n",
    "- Pandas, NumPy\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- CatBoost\n",
    "- FastAPI\n",
    "- HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the task deals with medical diagnostics, the emphasis is on **Recall/Sensitivity**: it is important to minimize the number of missed high-risk patients. Precision, F-score, and ROC-AUC were also considered for a comprehensive evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps in the notebook:\n",
    "1. Familiarization with the data (EDA).\n",
    "2. Preprocessing (type casting, handling missing values, processing correlations and leakage).\n",
    "3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "4. Metric selection and justification.\n",
    "5. Preparing artifacts for inference.\n",

    "## Final findings from exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Train set (training data)\n",
    "- **Target variable**:\n",
    "  - `Heart Attack Risk (Binary)` is imbalanced: roughly **65% class 0 (low risk)** and **35% class 1 (high risk)**.\n",
    "  - This proportion is acceptable but requires careful metric selection. The **Recall/F2** metric may be preferable to Accuracy to avoid missing rare positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing values**:\n",
    "  - Found **243 rows with multiple missing values** (about 3% of the dataset).\n",
    "  - The gaps are **systemic**: entire blocks of values are missing for groups of patients, indicating data collection specifics rather than random errors.\n",
    "  - Solution: keep the `block_missing` flag and encode categorical gaps as `Unknown`. This allows the model to use the fact of a \"missing block\" as a potential risk factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature typing**:\n",
    "  - Binary features (`Gender`, `Smoking`, `Diabetes`, `Family History`) converted to **boolean**.\n",
    "  - Categorical features (`Diet`, `Alcohol Consumption`) converted to **categorical** type.\n",
    "  - Discrete variables (`Stress Level`, `Physical Activity Days Per Week`) converted to **integers**.\n",
    "  - Continuous features (`Cholesterol`, `BMI`, `Blood Pressure`) left as numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Test set (data for final evaluation)\n",
    "- **Overall structure**:\n",
    "  - The distributions of the test data are comparable to the train set, indicating they come from the same population.\n",
    "  - The balance of key features is preserved; categorical shares and ranges of numerical variables remain within train limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing values**:\n",
    "  - Systemic gaps are also present in the test set; the structure matches the train data.\n",
    "  - The `block_missing` flag and encoded categorical `Unknown` values enable processing these cases without losing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomalies and outliers**:\n",
    "  - Extreme values in the test set fall within train ranges; no new artifacts were found.\n",
    "  - This reduces the risk that the model encounters unknown patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Overall dataset summary\n",
    "- After preprocessing, **there are no `NaN` gaps**: they are either replaced with categorical `Unknown` values or moved to a separate flag.\n",
    "- Class balance is sufficient for proper training but requires metrics that account for Recall.\n",
    "- Feature typing is strict: boolean, categorical, numerical, and discrete values are converted to the correct format.\n",
    "- Systemic gaps are captured through the `block_missing` factor, preserving their informativeness instead of discarding data.\n",
    "- Feature distributions in the test set match those in the train set, ensuring model transferability.\n",
    "- Bottom line: the data are ready for training, the structure is clean and reproducible, and they reflect both \"direct\" risk factors (biochemistry, blood pressure) and \"indirect\" ones (systemic gaps).\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Thus, we have a clean and ready dataset in which **all original information is preserved**, including hidden patterns in the missing values. This lays the foundation for building a stable model and sound validation.\n",
